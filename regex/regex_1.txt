Once is not enough

From there, you can repeat parts of your pattern with quantifiers. For example, the pattern ab?c matches 'abc' or 'ac' because the ? quantifier makes the subpattern it modifies optional. Other quantifiers are

* (zero or more times)
+ (one or more times)
{n} (exactly n times)
{n,} (at least n times)
{n,m} (at least n times but no more than m times)
Putting some of these blocks together, the pattern [Nn]*ick matches all of

ick
Nick
nick
Nnick
nNick
nnick
(and so on)
